# toynn: Minimal Examples showing creation of Neural Networks

The idea is to create minimal examples in each framework. The task at hand is to classify waveforms into sine, square and sawtooth. 

The goal of the code is to be as concise as possible.

TODO:
* Refactor the code so that the generation of training and test data is done in common.
